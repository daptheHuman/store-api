# Store-APIüè™

This project is a Node.js backend that provides an API for a store.

## Project Overviewüìù

The Store-API project is a Node.js backend that handles user-related functionalities for a store. It allows administrators to retrieve user information, update user details, and delete users. Certain operations require authentication and authorization.

## Features‚ú®

- Retrieve all users (admin only)
- Retrieve information for a specific user (admin only)
- Update user details (authentication and authorization required)
- Delete a user (authentication and authorization required)

## Folder StructureüìÇ

The project follows the following folder structure:

- `controllers/`: Contains the controller files that handle the logic for each API endpoint.
- `middleware/`: Contains the middleware files that provide additional functionality for the API.
- `routes/`: Contains the route files that define the API endpoints and connect them to the appropriate controller functions.
- `index.js`: The main entry point of the application.

## Prerequisitesüìù

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Node.js (v18.13.0)
- Express.js
- MongoDB (or any other supported database)

## Installationüì•

Follow these steps to install and configure the project:

1. Clone the repository
2. Change to the project directory:

```shell
cd store-api
```

3. Install dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

4. Configure environment variables:

   Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and set the values for the following variables:

   - PRODUCTION: Set to false for development mode.
   - MONGOOSE_URL: The URL of your MongoDB database.
   - PORT: The port on which the server will listen.
   - JWT_SECRET: Secret key for JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication.
   - MIDTRANS_MERCHANT_ID: Merchant ID for Midtrans payment integration.
   - MIDTRANS_CLIENT_KEY: Client key for Midtrans payment integration.
   - MIDTRANS_SERVER_KEY: Server key for Midtrans payment integration.

## Usage‚öôÔ∏è

To run the server in development mode, use the following command:

```shell
npm run dev
```

This command will start the server using a development environment configuration, allowing you to make changes and automatically restart the server whenever code changes are detected.

To start the server in production mode, use the following command:

```shell
npm start
```

This command will start the server using a production environment configuration, optimized for performance and stability.

The server will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000` by default. You can modify the port in the `.env` file if needed.
